TurtleSense
===========

Please see http://turtlesense.org for an overview of the project.  There are three devices, and each has its own embedded code

  Comm Head -- This is the code in the communications tower.  It is the master controller of the entire system.  It controls the smart sensor and the Janus phone board.  Once activated, these units send out regular reports over the cell network
  
  Hand Held Unit -- A communiccations tower, modified so that it can be a portable device to test and register sensors when they are first installed in the nest.  GPS is acrtive in these devices to locate the nest site.  Modifications also include an on/off switch, and LEDs that indicate cell phone reception, low battery, sensor malfunction, and GPS lock.  Once the sensor completes testing successfully, the units single button can be pressed to register the date and location on the sensor, and also create a log entry on the web.
  
  Smart Sensor -- This is the code that runs the motion/temperature sensor, and collects and analyzes the data.
